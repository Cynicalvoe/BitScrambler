# BitScrambler
A personal file encryption program.

## Purpose
This program was created mostly out of boredom, but it serves a good purpose as a personal file protection system, too. If you have sensitive information that you want to keep safe, this quick tool can help you get the job done.

## How to use
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/xFyreWolfx/BitScrambler/releases/latest) to your Windows computer, and open the `.exe` file. If you plan on using this program for real files, please be sure to customize the salt in Window.cs to keep things extra-secure.

You can also clone or download this repository and change the program in your own copy of Visual Studio. Pull requests are always welcome and encouraged, if you feel you can make the program better.

### Disclaimer
I am not responsible for how you use this program. Damaged files, forgotten encryption keys, and legal implications are your responsibility. Always make backups, and only encrypt files that you own or have permission to change.
